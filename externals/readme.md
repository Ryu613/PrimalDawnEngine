# externals

externals are maintained by mixed style,

if a library is:

1. hard to configure or compile locally, or cmake not supported well(or problematic)
1. easy to download directly, and almost no update needed

then use compiled version

## manually maintained libraries

- `glad-api3_3_no_ext`
- `stb`
