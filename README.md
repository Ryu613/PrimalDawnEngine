# PrimalDawnEngine（WIP）

real-time PBR graphics engine

now just for personal study, not finished yet

## self-discipline

1. all handcraft, no copy paste
1. keep code in low entropy as much as possible
1. always add comment/doc for important/complex things
1. make it works first, then make it better
